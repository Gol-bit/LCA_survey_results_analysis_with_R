Digital Content Creators Analysis Using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) With R 

Overview

This project applies Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to survey data from digital content creators (bloggers) to uncover insights into their content posting behaviors, promotional strategies, content creation tool investments, and revenue sources. The survey targeted questions that predominantly had binary (yes/no) responses.

Methodology

LCA was chosen to identify hidden classes among bloggers based on their survey responses, leading to the classification of creators into three distinct groups according to their level of activity, investment in content, and monetization methods:

Passive Creators: Those primarily posting content without significant investment in development or monetization.

Active Creators: Creators investing in certain tools for content creation and promotion, earning from a few sources.

Business-Minded Creators: Bloggers investing in a wide range of promotional and content creation tools, with multiple revenue streams.

Findings

The LCA revealed unique behavioral patterns, offering a foundation for targeted marketing strategies and support by platforms and brands. The results highlight the importance of tailored approaches to each creator group to maximize their potential and meet their needs effectively.

Application

This analysis is useful for marketers, content platform providers, tool developers for creators, and the bloggers themselves to understand their position in the digital content ecosystem better.
